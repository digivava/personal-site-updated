      <h2>Ruby and C#</h2>
      <h3>March 25, 2016</h3>

      <p>Hi again journal! Today I hung out with my old friend Julia from Boston, and that was cool because she's a professional  developer herself! So she was excited to hear I was in Ada, and she showed me some cool desktop applications that she made in C#. Then she walked me through debugging some C# code, which was cool because I got a chance to really see some of the differences between Ruby and other languages!</p>

      <p>Being able to explain how Ruby works to her was exciting because it was the first time I felt like somewhat of an expert on something while talking to a "real programmer". Yay!</p>

      <p>Some interesting things I learned about Ruby, through learning about C#:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In Ruby, every method must return a value. In C#, some methods don't return anything, and these methods are marked with the word "void" when they're defined. A method that doesn't return anything?! Wha?! Apparently that's super common, too.</li>

        <li>There are no implicit returns in C#. You have to put "return value;" if you want the method to return the value. I appreciate that Ruby has implicit returns, and I can see how Matz tried to make "programming fun for the programmer" or whatever by including things like that. I guess C# needs
        explicit returns because of the fact that not all methods return values.</li>

        <li>In the arguments of a C# method, you also have to include the object type of the parameter value being passed into the method. This seems like it would be really annoying! What if you wanted multiple object types to be okay? Maybe there's other ways to do it, or maybe you have to always make sure that everything is converted to the same object type before it's passed in... hmm... thanks Matz! :D</li>

        <li>C# methods have to be defined with public, private, or protected. This shows the scope of the method. From my limited understanding I think public methods can be accessed from any class in the program, private methods can only be accessed within that class, and protected can only be accessed through inheritance.</li>

        <li>I know scope is really important in Ruby too, but it feels kinda different.. in Ruby we seem to refer to other class's methods by requiring the other file and using the module as a namespace. I'm not sure if that's just the "best practices" way that Jeremy has been teaching us, or if that's just the only way to do it in Ruby, but either way I feel like the way we've been referring to methods in other classes so far is a little easier to understand when reading code later.</li>

        <li>While so far everything has me liking Ruby more than C#, I gotta say, I appreciate that in C# all the methods require a () after them anytime they're used, because it helps me identify them as a method as opposed to a variable!</li>
      </ol>

      <p>All in all, I liked learning a little bit about C# because it helped me see the cool parts of Ruby, and understand how Ruby is trying to make programming easier for programmers.</p>
