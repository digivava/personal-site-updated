      <h2>OOP Discoveries</h2>
      <h3>March 22, 2016</h3>
      <p>Hi journal. HOW'S IT GOING? Your life is probably not that exciting, what with you just being a journal and all, but I like to ask.</p>

      <p>I'm writing you in nano. Isn't that cool? I feel like a hacker. A lazy one,
      because the only reason I'm writing you in nano is because I'm too lazy to
      leave the command line.</p>

      <p>While going over the koans again, I learned (or maybe re-learned?) that
      the class of an object-id is a Fixnum. I guess I wasn't really thinking
      about it, that the object-id itself is a different object from the object it
      identifies. But it makes sense. Everything in Ruby is an object. EVERYTHING!!</p>

      <p>Honestly the super-object-orientedness makes sense to me. I think it will be
      weird learning other OOP languages where they're not fully embracing the whole
      "everything is an object" lifestyle. Why half-ass it?</p>

      <p>It's got me curious about the endless rabbitholes that I've already gotten
      a little taste of, from certain weird object types I've stumbled across that I
      don't understand yet. Like the Singleton class and the IO class. WHAT ARE
      THESE MYSTERIES? HOW ABSTRACT DOES IT GET?</p>

      <p>I think for some reason I thought that the object-id was its own class, but I
      guess not. object_id seems to just be an attribute of a given object, with a
      value of the class Fixnum. Yay.</p>
